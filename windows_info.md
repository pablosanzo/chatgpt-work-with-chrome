Description
-----------

Use the `chrome.windows` API to interact with browser windows. You can use this API to create, modify, and rearrange windows in the browser.

Permissions
-----------

When requested, a [`windows.Window`](#type-Window) contains an array of [`tabs.Tab`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#type-Tab) objects. You must declare the `"tabs"` permission in your [manifest](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#manifest) if you need access to the [`url`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#property-Tab-url), [`pendingUrl`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#property-Tab-pendingUrl), [`title`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#property-Tab-title), or [`favIconUrl`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#property-Tab-favIconUrl) properties of [`tabs.Tab`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#type-Tab). For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": ["tabs"],
  ...
}

```


Concepts and usage
------------------

### The current window

Many functions in the extension system take an optional `windowId` argument, which defaults to the current window.

The _current window_ is the window that contains the code that is currently executing. It's important to realize that this can be different from the topmost or focused window.

For example, say an extension creates a few tabs or windows from a single HTML file, and that the HTML file contains a call to [`tabs.query()`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#method-query). The current window is the window that contains the page that made the call, no matter what the topmost window is.

In the case of [service workers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/service-workers), the value of the current window falls back to the last active window. Under some circumstances, there may be no current window for background pages.

Examples
--------

To try this API, install the [windows API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/windows) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples) repository.

![Two windows, each with one tab](https://developer.chrome.com/static/docs/extensions/reference/api/windows/images/windows.png)

Two windows, each with one tab.

Types
-----

### CreateType

Specifies what type of browser window to create. 'panel' is deprecated and is available only to existing allowlisted extensions on Chrome OS.

#### Enum

"normal"  
Specifies the window as a standard window.

"popup"  
Specifies the window as a popup window.

"panel"  
Specifies the window as a panel.

### QueryOptions

#### Properties

*   populate
    
    boolean optional
    
    If true, the [`windows.Window`](#type-Window) object has a `tabs` property that contains a list of the [`tabs.Tab`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs/#type-Tab) objects. The `Tab` objects only contain the `url`, `pendingUrl`, `title`, and `favIconUrl` properties if the extension's manifest file includes the `"tabs"` permission.
    
*   windowTypes
    
    [WindowType](#type-WindowType)\[\] optional
    
    If set, the [`windows.Window`](#type-Window) returned is filtered based on its type. If unset, the default filter is set to `['normal', 'popup']`.
    

### Window

#### Properties

*   Whether the window is set to be always on top.
    
*   Whether the window is currently the focused window.
    
*   The height of the window, including the frame, in pixels. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `height` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.
    
*   The ID of the window. Window IDs are unique within a browser session. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned an `ID` property; for example, when querying windows using the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API, in which case a session ID may be present.
    
*   Whether the window is incognito.
    
*   The offset of the window from the left edge of the screen in pixels. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `left` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.
    
*   sessionId
    
    string optional
    
    The session ID used to uniquely identify a window, obtained from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.
    
*   state
    
    [WindowState](#type-WindowState) optional
    
    The state of this browser window.
    
*   Array of [`tabs.Tab`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs/#type-Tab) objects representing the current tabs in the window.
    
*   The offset of the window from the top edge of the screen in pixels. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `top` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.
    
*   The type of browser window this is.
    
*   The width of the window, including the frame, in pixels. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `width` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.
    

### WindowState

The state of this browser window. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `state` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.

#### Enum

"normal"  
Normal window state (not minimized, maximized, or fullscreen).

"minimized"  
Minimized window state.

"maximized"  
Maximized window state.

"fullscreen"  
Fullscreen window state.

"locked-fullscreen"  
Locked fullscreen window state. This fullscreen state cannot be exited by user action and is available only to allowlisted extensions on Chrome OS.

### WindowType

The type of browser window this is. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `type` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.

#### Enum

"normal"  
A normal browser window.

"popup"  
A browser popup.

"panel"  
_Deprecated in this API._ A Chrome App panel-style window. Extensions can only see their own panel windows.

"app"  
_Deprecated in this API._ A Chrome App window. Extensions can only see their app own windows.

"devtools"  
A Developer Tools window.

Properties
----------

### WINDOW\_ID\_CURRENT

The windowId value that represents the [current window](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/windows/#the_current_window).

### WINDOW\_ID\_NONE

The windowId value that represents the absence of a Chrome browser window.

Methods
-------

### create()

```
chrome.windows.create(

```


Creates (opens) a new browser window with any optional sizing, position, or default URL provided.

#### Parameters

*   createData
    
    object optional
    
    *   If `true`, opens an active window. If `false`, opens an inactive window.

        Whether the new window should be an incognito window.
        
    *   The number of pixels to position the new window from the left edge of the screen. If not specified, the new window is offset naturally from the last focused window. This value is ignored for panels.
        
    *   setSelfAsOpener
        
        boolean optional
        
        If `true`, the newly-created window's 'window.opener' is set to the caller and is in the same [unit of related browsing contexts](https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/browsers.html#unit-of-related-browsing-contexts) as the caller.
        
    *   state
